      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a frontend developer with a particular interest in making things
        simple and looking good. I try to keep up with best practices and am
        always looking for new things to learn. I am also a former CEO and
        co-owner of a private tutoring school Foster High and I am putting my 6
        years of experience in running a firm into a daily use in a web
        development.
